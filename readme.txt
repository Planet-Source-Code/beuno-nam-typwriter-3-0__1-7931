This is a re-make of a similar program I downloaded from www.planet-source-code.com.
I don´t know the authors name, but thanks for the original code.
I added:
- the pause/resume
- the possibility to change the typing speed
- the possibility to type as many things as you want
The exe is compresses, so it´s 8.5k, so dont be surprised when you compile and get a 24k one.

I don´t think I will update this code, but any suggestions are welcome.
